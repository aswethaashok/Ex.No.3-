### Aim: To design an AI-powered chatbot that assists customers in resolving issues related to product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiries. The chatbot should handle various customer queries efficiently while maintaining a conversational and user-friendly tone. In this experiment, we will employ different prompt patterns to guide the development process of the chatbot, ranging from basic task-oriented prompts to more complex, persona-driven prompts. Case study 1 with Straightforward Prompts, Tabular Format Prompting and Preceding Question Prompting  

### Explanation - Any one use case from Unit 5 and generate the report for that with the unit 2 Prompt type
Procedure:
1.	Define the Scenario and Use Case:
Scenario:
The manufacturing industry is looking to reduce manual monitoring and increase efficiency through automation. The system will utilize IoT devices and embedded controllers to automate equipment, monitor performance, and enable predictive maintenance. The goal is to streamline the production process, minimize downtime, and enhance energy efficiency.
Target Audience:
Manufacturing companies, specifically in sectors like automotive, electronics, and food processing, where automation can significantly improve productivity.


Main Objectives:

•	Improve production efficiency by 30%.
•	Minimize machinery downtime with predictive maintenance.
•	Enable real-time monitoring and remote control of manufacturing systems.
•	Reduce energy consumption by optimizing processes.
 
2.	Identify Prompt Patterns for Each Design Aspect:
Idea Generation Prompts:

•	Prompt: “What features can be incorporated into the automation system to optimize production and reduce downtime?” Generated Ideas:
•	Sensors for real-time monitoring of equipment performance.
•	Predictive maintenance alerts to anticipate equipment failures.
•	Energy usage optimization by automating the switching of machines on/off based on demand.
•	Cloud-based dashboards for remote monitoring and control of machinery.

Persona and Context Prompts:

•	Prompt: “What should the user interface and control system convey to the operators and managers?” Generated Context:
•	The user interface should be intuitive and provide real-time data on machine performance, energy usage, and alerts.
•	The system should convey reliability and ease of use, with minimal training required for operators.

## Output:

1. Straightforward Prompts

Definition: A straightforward prompt is direct and explicit. The AI is given a clear instruction or question, with minimal context or formatting requirements.

Example (Customer Support Chatbot):
Prompt:
```
"Explain how to reset my Wi-Fi router."
```

Expected AI Response:

"To reset your Wi-Fi router, press and hold the reset button on the back of the router for 10 seconds. Wait until the lights blink and the router restarts."

Use case: Ideal for quick responses to common customer queries like product troubleshooting, account help, or order status.

2. Tabular Format Prompting

Definition: The AI is instructed to present information in a table format. This is useful for comparing options, displaying step-by-step procedures, or organizing data clearly.

Example (Customer Support Chatbot):
Prompt:

```
"Provide a troubleshooting guide for common printer issues in a table with columns: Issue, Possible Cause, Solution."
```

| Issue                | Possible Cause   | Solution                           |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Printer not printing | Paper jam        | Open the tray, remove jammed paper |
| Print quality poor   | Low ink or toner | Replace ink cartridge or toner     |
| Printer offline      | Connection issue | Check Wi-Fi or USB connection      |

Use case: Helps users quickly understand and compare solutions for multiple problems.

3. Missing Word Prompting

Definition: Part of the prompt is intentionally left blank, and the AI must fill in the missing word or phrase. This is effective for quizzes, interactive guidance, or testing comprehension.

Example (Customer Support Chatbot):
Prompt:
```
"To track an order, go to the ______ section on our website and enter your order ID."
```

Expected AI Response:
```
"To track an order, go to the 'Order Tracking' section on our website and enter your order ID."
```

Use case: Engages users interactively, or provides step-by-step guidance where users can fill in missing information.

4. Preceding Question Prompting

Definition: The AI is given a context or preceding question to guide its next response. This ensures coherent multi-turn conversations in chatbots.

Example (Customer Support Chatbot):
Prompt:
```
User: "My order hasn’t arrived yet."
AI Preceding Question Prompt: "What is the order ID for the delayed shipment?"
```

Expected AI Response:
```
"Could you please provide your order ID so I can check the delivery status?"
```

Use case: Helps maintain a natural conversation flow, gather necessary details, and resolve issues efficiently.

| Prompt Type                  | Definition                                 | Chatbot Example                                       |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Straightforward Prompt       | Direct instruction/question to AI          | "Explain how to reset my Wi-Fi router."               |
| Tabular Format Prompting     | AI responds in a structured table          | Troubleshooting guide for printer issues              |
| Missing Word Prompting       | Part of prompt blank; AI fills in          | "Go to the \_\_\_\_\_\_ section to track your order." |
| Preceding Question Prompting | Uses previous context to guide AI response | "What is your order ID for the delayed shipment?"     |



### Conclusion
Result: The various types of Prompts are executed successfully with generated the report.
